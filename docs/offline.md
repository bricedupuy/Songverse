# Working offline

Status: **agreed design**, nothing built yet. This is how SongVerse keeps
working without a network, in phases. The decisions it rests on are
[below](#decisions).

## Why

Songs are used where the network is worst: a church hall, a basement
rehearsal room, a festival stage. Perform and practice modes are only
trustworthy if tonight's set opens with no Wi-Fi. Editing on a train is
nice to have; reading at the venue is essential.

## Three levels

| Level | What works offline | Conflicts | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Read | Upcoming sets, your own songs, songbooks you keep; charts and files | None: read-only | Phase 1 |
| 2. Create and personal changes | New songs; your notes, chart preferences, set order | None for new songs; rare for personal data (one owner) | Phase 2, soon after |
| 3. Shared editing | Editing songs other people also edit | Real: needs merging | Much later, with real-time collaboration |

## Decisions

1. **Start read-only.** Creating new songs offline comes soon after.
2. **Downloaded automatically:** upcoming sets and the songs in them, and
   every song the user created. A songbook can be set to **keep a local
   copy**. Audio is never downloaded by default.
3. **Real-time collaboration someday, in the distant future.** Editing
   shared songs offline waits for it.
4. **A mobile app is expected within six months, maybe sooner.** It will
   be either native or React Native (not decided), so the sync protocol
   must work for both (see [The mobile app](#the-mobile-app)).

## Where we start from

What stops it today:

- **Pages are drawn on the web server.** TanStack Start draws each page on
  the server, and route loaders call the API. `_protected.tsx`'s
  `beforeLoad` calls `loadAppData()` (`apps/web/src/lib/app-data.ts`),
  which asks the web server for the session (`server-auth.ts` forwards the
  cookie to the API). With no network that fails, and the user is sent to
  sign in.
- **Nothing is stored in the browser** except the API token and a
  one-minute in-memory cache of the sidebar lists. Every page loads its
  data fresh.

What already helps:

- **The chart is drawn in the browser** from the document alone:
  `SongChart`, `layoutChordLine`, `transposeChord` (core). An offline chart
  only needs the song's JSON.
- **Stable IDs everywhere and a `revision` per song**
  (`docs/song-document-v2.md`). Sync and merge need both.
- **Core is shared.** Offline logic (the local store's shape, the sync
  protocol, merging) belongs there, so a mobile app reuses it.

## Phase 1: reading offline

### The app itself (service worker)

- A web app manifest and a service worker make SongVerse installable (a
  PWA) and keep its code: the JS and CSS bundles, fonts, icons and an
  **app shell** - a page that boots the app in the browser without the
  server. TanStack Start can build that shell next to the server-drawn
  pages.
- **Online, nothing changes:** pages are still drawn on the server.
- **Offline, the service worker serves the shell for any page** and the
  app runs entirely in the browser.
- **Updates:** a new version installs in the background and applies on the
  next launch, never in the middle of a performance.

How it's built (#49):

- **The shell** is TanStack Start's SPA-mode shell (`spa` in
  `apps/web/vite.config.ts`): the root document with no page in it,
  prerendered at build time to `dist/client/_shell.html`. Server-drawn
  pages are unaffected. `server.mjs` serves it at `/_shell`, with this
  server's `API_URL` and the real stylesheet name put in (both were fixed
  at build time).
- **The service worker** is `apps/web/public/sw.js`. `server.mjs` serves
  it with the build's ID and file list (`/assets/*`, the web app manifest,
  the icon) filled in, so a deploy is a new service worker. It keeps them
  all on install. A page request goes to the network first; if there's no
  answer in 6 seconds, or the server fails (5xx), it gets the shell
  instead. In development the placeholders stay and it does nothing.
- **The session:** once in the browser, the signed-in layout keeps the
  session and sidebar lists (`keepAppDataOffline`). `loadAppData()` falls
  back to them when a request fails for want of a network, or doesn't
  answer in 8 seconds. It then marks the data `offline`, which shows the
  banner. The server saying there's no session deletes the copy, as do the
  sign-in page and **Sign out**. An auth server error (5xx) is not "signed
  out" (`server-auth.ts`), so it never deletes the copy.
- **A page with nothing kept** fails its loader with a network error. The
  router's default error component (`components/route-error.tsx`) says
  "Not available offline".

Sets (#50):

- **`GET /setlists/:id/offline`** returns the set and each item's song view,
  exactly what the set's song page and Live render. So offline they render
  the same way; no second renderer.
- **`@songverse/core`'s `offline/`** holds the logic over an `OfflineStorage`
  interface: `keepSet`, `keptSetDetail`, `keptSetSong`, `searchKeptSongs`,
  `findKeptSong`. The web app's adapter is `deviceStorage()` in
  `apps/web/src/lib/offline-data.ts`, over `offline-db.ts`.
- **Kept as opened:** the set page, a set's song page and Live download the
  set once they're in the browser (`useKeepSet`, at most once a minute per
  set). Their loaders use `onlineOrKept()`: the API, or with no network the
  kept copy. Offline, the set page is read-only.
- **Search and a lone song in Live** fall back to the songs of kept sets,
  played as written with the player's chord settings.
- For now nothing is removed from the device except by signing out; #51
  adds what's kept automatically, catching up and dropping old sets.

### The data (IndexedDB)

One IndexedDB database per signed-in user:

| Store | Holds | Key |
|---|---|---|
| `session` | The last known session (user, locale, roles) and when it was confirmed | singleton |
| `sets` | `SetlistDetail` as the API returns it | set ID |
| `songs` | The song's detail (details, sections, flow, capo, attachments list) with its `revision` and `updatedAt` | song version ID |
| `songbooks` | Kept songbooks with their entries | songbook ID |
| `files` | Attachment blobs (PDF, images, audio when asked for) | content hash |
| `meta` | The last manifest, pins, sizes | key |

- **What's downloaded automatically:**
  - **Upcoming sets:** every set the user can open (their own and their
    teams') whose date is from yesterday to 14 days ahead, with every song
    in it. The 14 days is a user setting. A set with no date is only
    downloaded if pinned.
  - **The user's own songs:** every song they created (owner scope USER).
  - **Songbooks with "Keep a local copy" on:** the songbook's entries and
    the songs they link to. Each songbook has the setting, off by default.
  - **Anything pinned:** the user can pin any set or song ("Available
    offline").
- **Files:**
  - PDFs, images and ChordPro files of those songs come with them.
  - **Audio is never downloaded by default.** A set, song or songbook can
    add its audio on request ("Include audio").
  - Files are content-addressed, so one shared by several songs is stored
    once.
- **Storage:**
  - ask for persistent storage with `navigator.storage.persist()`,
    otherwise the browser may evict it;
  - show how much space is used, per set and songbook, with a way to
    remove it.
- **Leaving the device:** a set drops off a day after its date unless
  pinned; a song stays while any reason to keep it holds (in a kept set or
  songbook, the user's own, pinned).

### Loading pages

A small data layer sits between the route loaders and `apiClient`:

- **Online:** fetch from the API as today, and write through to IndexedDB
  for anything that's kept offline.
- **Offline (or when a request fails because there's no network):** read
  from IndexedDB. Anything not stored gets a clear "Not available offline"
  page, never a sign-in redirect.
- **Session:** `loadAppData()` falls back to the stored session when the
  network is down. The user stays signed in, read-only, and the app says
  so.
  - When the connection is back, the session is checked again first. If
    it's gone (signed out elsewhere, banned, deleted), the local data is
    wiped.
- **Offline banner:** it shows how fresh the data is ("Updated 2 hours
  ago"). Editing controls are disabled offline.

This could be TanStack Query with its persisted cache, or a hand-written
store. Choose when building it; TanStack Query is the less custom option.

### API support

- `GET /offline/manifest` - everything this user should have offline right
  now: upcoming set IDs, their own song IDs, kept songbook IDs, pins, each
  with its `revision`/`updatedAt`. The client compares it with what it has
  and fetches the difference. Server-side, the rules above live in one
  place for every client.
- `GET /setlists/:id/offline` and `GET /songbooks/:id/offline` - a set (or
  songbook) with every song as it's shown, and attachment metadata, in one
  response. `POST /song-versions/offline` with IDs - a batch of songs. This
  replaces one request per song.
- The songbook's **"Keep a local copy"** and pins are stored per user on
  the server, so they follow the user to a new device.
- `GET /sync/changes?since=<cursor>` - what changed for this user since the
  cursor: updated sets and songs (IDs and revisions), **deletions** and
  **lost access** (a song unshared, a team left). The client refreshes
  what changed and removes the rest.
- Attachments are content-addressed already, so they can be fetched
  once and cached indefinitely (`Cache-Control: immutable` on the
  attachment's hash URL).

### Security

- **Local data is readable by anyone who has the device unlocked.** State
  that plainly in the "Available offline" help.
- **Losing access:** songs the user no longer has access to are removed
  at the next sync, so a lost device keeps its copies until then.
- **Signing out** deletes the user's IndexedDB database and cached files.
- **Scope:** only what the user could already see is ever downloaded; the
  endpoints re-check access like every other.

## Phase 2: creating songs and personal changes offline

### New songs

A song created offline has nobody else editing it, so there's nothing to
merge:

- The editor works as usual. The song is saved to IndexedDB with a
  **local ID** and marked "Not synced yet". Its sections, lines and chords
  get their normal IDs, generated on the device.
- Its creation is queued in the **outbox** with an **idempotency key**
  (`POST /song-versions` accepts `Idempotency-Key`), so sending it twice
  after a flaky reconnect still makes one song.
- **Once it's sent,** the server's ID replaces the local one everywhere on
  the device: the local song, pins, and any set that already uses it. Set
  items point at the local ID until then.
- **Refused (a title clash the user must resolve, a quota reached):** the
  song stays local and the reason is shown, never lost.
- **Further offline edits** to a song created offline change the queued
  creation rather than adding updates on top.

**Editing your own songs offline** can follow, once creation works. Those
songs have one owner, but possibly two devices. The save carries the
`revision` it started from, as today. If the song moved on meanwhile, the
user chooses "Keep mine" or "Keep the other version", with the difference
shown. No merge.

### Personal changes

- Changes to things only the user owns are queued in the **outbox** in
  IndexedDB and sent in order when back online:
  - personal notes on a set's songs;
  - chart preferences (`chart-preferences/v1`: hidden chords, simplified
    chords);
  - their own set's order and keys.
- They're one owner, per field: **last write wins**, using the time of
  the change, so an edit made offline and synced later doesn't overwrite
  a newer one.
- **Sending:** each queued change carries an ID, so sending it twice is
  harmless.
- **Failures:** a change refused on reconnect (access lost, set deleted)
  is shown to the user, never dropped silently.

## Phase 3: editing shared songs offline (much later)

This is the same problem as **real-time collaboration**: several people
changing one song without talking to the server in between. Real-time
collaboration is for the distant future, so shared songs stay read-only
offline until then. When it comes, both are built together. The two
options, for then:

### Option A: merge on reconnect (fits what we have)

- The offline editor saves against the `revision` it started from.
- **Today:** a stale save is refused (409).
- **Instead, a three-way merge by ID:**
  - base = the revision the edit started from;
  - theirs = the stored song;
  - yours = the edit.
- Most edits merge cleanly: different lines, a chord moved in one place
  and a lyric fixed in another, a section added on each side. Only the
  same line or chord changed on both sides is a conflict, shown side by
  side for the user to pick.
- Stable section, line and chord IDs make this tractable; the merge
  lives in core.
- **Cost:** moderate. No live co-editing.

### Option B: a CRDT (Yjs)

- Each song is a Yjs document, kept locally with `y-indexeddb` and synced
  through a small sync server (or `y-websocket` / Hocuspocus). Tiptap's
  collaboration extension edits it directly.
- Offline edits merge automatically, and **live co-editing** (with other
  people's cursors) comes with it.
- **The stored SongDocument becomes a snapshot** written from the Yjs state.
  Arrangements and IDs keep working from that snapshot.
- **Cost:** larger - the Yjs model of a song, the sync server, snapshots,
  access control on the socket.

**Plan:** live co-editing is wanted someday, so when this is built, go
to Yjs directly rather than building the merge first. Until then, nothing
in Phases 1-2 gets in its way. Stable IDs and the stored SongDocument are
what a Yjs model would snapshot to.

## Testing

- Playwright can take the browser offline (`context.setOffline(true)`),
  but that doesn't reach a service worker's own requests. With
  `PW_EXPERIMENTAL_SERVICE_WORKER_NETWORK_EVENTS=1` set before Playwright
  loads, `context.route()` does, so the suites also abort every request
  (see `e2e/web/offline.test.mjs`).
- An e2e suite would:
  1. mark a set available offline, go offline, reload, and check that the
     set, a chart and a PDF open;
  2. check that an unpinned song says "Not available offline";
  3. check that nothing redirects to sign-in;
  4. come back online and check that a song unshared in the meantime is
     removed.
- Phase 2 adds:
  - create a song offline, reconnect, and check that it exists once with
    its chords' IDs, even if the connection drops mid-send;
  - change a note offline, reconnect, and see it saved;
  - the same change from two devices keeps the newer one.

## The mobile app

Expected within six months, possibly sooner; native or React Native isn't
decided. Either way, offline is its core feature (perform mode at the
venue), so the sync design has to serve it from the start:

- **The protocol is the API, documented.** The manifest, batch downloads,
  changes feed and outbox rules are plain HTTP + JSON endpoints, described
  in the OpenAPI docs the API already serves (`/api/docs`), so any client
  can implement them. Anything a client needs to decide (what to keep
  offline) is decided by the server's manifest, not reimplemented per
  client.
- **The formats are specified:** `docs/song-document-v2.md`,
  `docs/arrangement-document-v2.md`.
- **Storage:** IndexedDB on the web; SQLite and the file system on mobile.
  The same tables either way.

What the choice changes:

| | React Native (Expo) | Native (Swift + Kotlin) |
|---|---|---|
| Reuses from `@songverse/core` | Everything in TypeScript: song and arrangement schemas, chord reading and transposition, chart layout (`layoutChordLine`), text import/export, i18n, the API client, and the web app's offline store logic | Nothing: all of it written twice more, and kept in step |
| Offline storage | SQLite (expo-sqlite), files via expo-file-system | Core Data / Room, and the platforms' file APIs |
| Chart rendering | Its own components, same layout data as the web | Its own, per platform |
| Feel, platform APIs | Very good; native modules where needed | Best |

Since the chart layout, chord logic and sync client are the hard,
must-match parts, **React Native reuses most of what matters**. Whichever
is chosen, Phase 1's sync logic goes in core, as plain functions over a
storage interface, so a React Native app gets it for free. A native app
would port it from there.

## Rough sizes

| Phase | Work |
|---|---|
| 1 | Service worker and app shell, IndexedDB store, loader fallback, offline session, manifest and batch endpoints, "Keep a local copy" for songbooks, pins, storage UI, e2e suite - about 2 weeks |
| 2 | Outbox with idempotent sends, creating songs offline (local IDs swapped for server IDs), personal changes with last write wins, failure notices - about 1 to 2 weeks; editing your own songs offline adds about a week |
| 3 | Yjs model of a song, sync server, snapshots, collaboration UI - 3 weeks or more, when real-time collaboration is taken on |
