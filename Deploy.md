# Deploying Songverse

This documents the working deployment of Songverse to a self-hosted [Dokploy](https://dokploy.com) instance, using `songverse.one` as the domain: the web app at `app.songverse.one`, the API at `api.songverse.one`, the docs at `docs.songverse.one`, and the root domain for the website (#43). Follow this in order if you're setting it up from scratch, or use it as a reference if something needs fixing later.

## Architecture

Seven things get created in Dokploy, all in one Project:

| Resource | Type | Built from | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Postgres | Database | Dokploy's built-in template | Shared by API, Worker, and Web |
| Redis | Database | Dokploy's built-in template | Backs the background jobs' queues (BullMQ), the Worker's heartbeat, and rate limits shared by the API and the Worker |
| API | Application | `Dockerfile.api` | Serves the NestJS API, listens on port 3001 |
| Worker | Application | `Dockerfile.api` (same as API) | Same image as API, different start command — runs the background jobs |
| Web | Application | `Dockerfile.web` | The TanStack Start web app, listens on port 3000 |
| Docs | Application | `Dockerfile.docs` | The user documentation, a static site on port 80 |
| Site | Application | `Dockerfile.site` | The website at the root domain, a static page on port 80 |

The API and Worker share one Docker image because they're the same codebase — only the command that starts the container differs.

**What the Worker does** (#92): it runs every background job - bulk songbook uploads, recorded takes turned into Opus with ffmpeg (#127: `Dockerfile.api` installs it; running the Worker elsewhere, install ffmpeg there or takes stay WAV), the hourly clean-up of expired account transfers, and lookups (a new song's artwork, new artists' pictures and bios, the backfills started from Admin > Metadata). The API only adds jobs to the queues; with no Worker running they wait, so songs get no artwork and uploads aren't processed. Admin > Metadata > **Background jobs** shows whether a Worker is running (from a heartbeat it keeps in Redis), each queue's jobs and the last ones' results. For a small setup without a Worker, set `JOBS_IN_API=true` on the API and it runs the jobs itself (it does by default outside production, for `pnpm dev`).

## 1. DNS

Using deSEC.io (or any DNS host with similar record types):

- **A record**, subname `@` (apex/root) → your server's IP
- **A record**, subname `*` (wildcard) → your server's IP

This covers `songverse.one` and every subdomain (`api.songverse.one`, etc.) with two records.

Verify it resolves before touching Dokploy — cert issuance fails silently if DNS hasn't propagated:
```
dig +short songverse.one
dig +short api.songverse.one
```
Both should print your server's IP.

## 2. Dokploy setup

Create a **Project** to hold everything, then add these five resources.

### Postgres

**Database** → **Postgres**. Set a name and password, deploy it, and copy the connection string it gives you — that's your `DATABASE_URL` for the next three steps.

### Redis

**Database** → **Redis**. Copy its connection string too — that's `REDIS_URL`.

### API app

**Application**, configured as:
- Source: this repo, branch `main`
- Build type: **Dockerfile**
- Dockerfile path: `Dockerfile.api`
- Build context / base directory: `.` (repo root) — see [Gotcha #1](#1-docker-build-context) if this matters to you
- Port: `3001`
- Domain: `api.songverse.one`
- Watch paths (if you use auto-deploy): `apps/api/**`, `packages/core/**`, `packages/db/**`, `packages/secret-crypto/**`, `packages/tsconfig/**`, `Dockerfile.api`, `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml` - see [Watch paths](#watch-paths)

Environment variables:
```
DATABASE_URL=<Postgres connection string>
REDIS_URL=<Redis connection string>
PORT=3001

# BetterAuth lives here now (apps/api/src/auth/) - see below.
AUTH_URL=https://api.songverse.one
WEB_URL=https://app.songverse.one
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=<generate one — see below>
BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAILS=<comma-separated emails to auto-promote on sign-up>

SETTINGS_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<any long random string>

# Transactional email (verification + password reset) — fallback only,
# prefer Admin > Auth once the app is up. See below.
RESEND_API_KEY=<Resend API key>
EMAIL_FROM=Songverse <onboarding@resend.dev>

# Google sign-in — optional, also configurable via Admin > Auth. See below.
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<Google OAuth client ID>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<Google OAuth client secret>
```

**`AUTH_URL` vs `WEB_URL` vs `API_URL`, since it's easy to mix up:** `AUTH_URL` is this **API's own address** (BetterAuth is mounted here — see `apps/api/src/auth/`). `WEB_URL` is the **web app's** address — needed here because a WebAuthn passkey is tied to the browser's origin (the web app), not to wherever the auth server lives, and because verification/reset-password links redirect back into the web app, which BetterAuth has to explicitly trust as a foreign origin now that it's not the same app. `API_URL` (set on the **Web app only**, below) is this same API's address again, from the web app's point of view, for its ordinary (non-auth) data calls.

**Generating `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`:**
```
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))"
```
Keep this stable once set — BetterAuth encrypts its signing key with it in the database, so changing the secret without clearing the `Jwks` table breaks login for everyone until you do.

**`RESEND_API_KEY` / `EMAIL_FROM`:** email addresses now have to be verified before sign-in works (`emailAndPassword.requireEmailVerification` in `apps/api/src/auth/better-auth.ts`), and "forgot password" sends a reset link — both go out through [Resend](https://resend.com). Sign up for a free account, verify a sending domain (or use their shared `onboarding@resend.dev` sender for testing), and create an API key. The env vars here are a fallback: once the app is up, sign in as a global admin and set this at **Admin > Auth** instead — it takes effect immediately, no redeploy needed. Whichever path is used, if no Resend API key is configured at all, emails are logged to the container's stdout instead of sent — fine for local dev, **not fine in production** (nobody can verify their account). The app only ever sends account emails (verification, password reset, and the two-step email change from the account page), never bulk/marketing mail, specifically to stay inside the free tier's daily/monthly send cap — don't add new call sites to `apps/api/src/auth/email.ts` without keeping that in mind.

**`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`:** optional, and also settable at **Admin > Auth** instead of these env vars. Leave both unset everywhere to keep email+password (and passkeys) as the only sign-in methods — the "Continue with Google" button only renders once either path is configured. To enable it, create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID at the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) with an authorized redirect URI of `<AUTH_URL>/api/auth/callback/google` (e.g. `https://api.songverse.one/api/auth/callback/google`).

**Passkeys** (`@better-auth/passkey`) need no extra configuration. Their relying-party ID is the parent domain `AUTH_URL` and `WEB_URL` share (`songverse.one`, see `apps/api/src/auth/auth-domains.ts`), not the web app's own hostname, so passkeys keep working if the web app moves to another subdomain. The origin they're checked against is `WEB_URL`'s.

**The session cookie is cross-subdomain by design** (`advanced.crossSubDomainCookies` in `better-auth.ts`): the web app (`app.songverse.one`) and this API (`api.songverse.one`) are different origins but the same *site* (same registrable domain), so a cookie scoped to `songverse.one` reaches both. That parent domain is derived automatically from `AUTH_URL` and `WEB_URL` (their shared suffix), so the two must be subdomains of one domain you own — the API refuses to start otherwise. Two subdomains of a shared hosting domain (e.g. two different `*.up.railway.app` hosts) won't work either: browsers refuse cookies scoped to a public suffix. This is also why the API's CORS config (`main.ts`) names the web app's exact origin with `credentials: true` rather than using a wildcard — browsers refuse to combine a wildcard `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` with credentialed (cookie-bearing) requests.

**Rate limits and the API docs** (issue #113) are set at **Admin > Security**; these optional env vars are the fallback: `RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED` (default `true` in production), `RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` (per signed-in user, default 600), `RATE_LIMIT_ANONYMOUS_PER_MINUTE` (per address before sign-in, default 120), `RATE_LIMIT_HEAVY_PER_MINUTE` (uploads, lookups and joins by link, default 30), `TRUSTED_PROXIES` (proxies in front of the API whose `X-Forwarded-For` is trusted; default 1 in production - Traefik) `API_DOCS_PUBLIC` (default `false` in production: `/api/docs` for global admins only) and `CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY` (`enforce`, `report-only` or `off`, default `enforce`: the web app's Content-Security-Policy, issue #114 - the web server asks the API for it every 15 seconds, and reports what it refuses to its own log as `CSP: …`). The counts live in Redis, so they hold across the API's instances.

**Sign-up by invitation only** (issue #198) is switched on at **Admin > Users** (under **Sign-up and invitations**); `SIGNUP_INVITE_ONLY=true` is the fallback (default `false`: anyone can sign up). The `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAILS` can always sign up, so a new server can't lock its admins out.

**Notifications by email** (issue #236) are switched on at **Admin > Notifications**; `NOTIFICATION_EMAILS=true` is the fallback (default `false`: notifications only show in the app). They're sent by the Worker, through the same Resend key as account mail, one email per person per batch; the links in them point at `WEB_URL` as the API knows it, since the Worker may run without it.

**Push notifications** (web push, issue #236) are set up at **Admin > Notifications** (**Generate keys**); `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`, `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` (generate a pair with `npx web-push generate-vapid-keys`) and `VAPID_SUBJECT` (`mailto:` or `https:`, default the web app's https address) are the fallback. The Worker posts to the browsers' push services (fcm.googleapis.com, push.services.mozilla.com, push.apple.com, notify.windows.com) over HTTPS, so it needs outbound access to them; no other address is accepted for a device. `PUSH_TEST_ORIGINS` lets the end-to-end suites use a stand-in push service - never set it in production.

**Stem separation** (issue #63) is set up at **Admin > Stem separation**, and given to people and teams through the **Stem separation** role (**Admin > Roles**, issue #160); these optional env vars are the fallback: `DEMUCS_API_URL` and `DEMUCS_API_KEY` (the Demucs API and its `X-API-Key`; without both, it isn't offered), `DEMUCS_FAST_MODEL` (default `htdemucs`), `DEMUCS_HQ_ENABLED` (default `true`: a finer pass later replaces the quick stems), `DEMUCS_HQ_MODEL` (default `htdemucs_ft`), `STEM_SEPARATION_MONTHLY_LIMIT` (per person in 30 days, default none) and `DEMUCS_CALLBACK_SECRET` (signs the server's webhooks; generated and kept in the database when not set). The Worker sends recordings and brings stems in; the Demucs server calls `${AUTH_URL}/stem-separation/callback` when they're ready, so it must be able to reach the API - if it can't, the Worker checks every 2 minutes.

**Object storage (R2) has two setup paths** — pick one:

1. **Preferred: Admin > Storage** (in the web app, once it's up). Enter the
   account ID, access key ID, secret access key, and bucket there; it's
   saved in the database (secret access key encrypted with
   `SETTINGS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`) and takes effect immediately, no redeploy or
   env var needed. This requires `SETTINGS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` to be set on
   **both** the API and Worker apps (same value on both — it's what
   decrypts the stored secret), generated with:
   ```
   node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))"
   ```
2. **Fallback: env vars**, only used when nothing has been saved via the
   admin dashboard:
   ```
   R2_ACCOUNT_ID=<Cloudflare account ID>
   R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<R2 API token access key ID>
   R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<R2 API token secret access key>
   R2_BUCKET=songverse
   ```
   `R2_ENDPOINT` is optional — leave it unset and it defaults to
   `https://<R2_ACCOUNT_ID>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`; only set it if using
   a custom R2 endpoint/domain.

**If neither path is configured**, song attachments (uploaded ChordPro
files, PDF sheet music scans) silently fall back to local disk inside the
container instead of erroring — fine for local dev, **broken in
production**: the API and Worker are separate containers with separate
disks, an upload handled by one won't be visible to the other, and nothing
survives a redeploy either way. Set one of the two paths before anyone
uploads an attachment or runs a bulk content upload for real. Admin >
Storage shows which path is currently active.

**Sync play** (#13) is a WebSocket on the API itself, at
`wss://api.songverse.one/sync` - the same app and port, nothing to add.
Dokploy's proxy (Traefik) passes WebSocket connections through as they
are; a proxy of your own in front must allow the `Upgrade` header. The
sessions live in Redis, so it works with more than one API instance.

### Worker app

**Application**, same source and Dockerfile as the API:
- Dockerfile path: `Dockerfile.api`
- Build context: `.`
- **No domain, no port** — it doesn't serve web traffic
- **Command override** (usually under an "Advanced" tab, field is typically called "Command"): `node dist/worker.js`
- Watch paths (if you use auto-deploy): the same as the API's - it's the same image, and must be rebuilt whenever the API is

Environment variables - only these three are required:
```
DATABASE_URL=...              # same as the API's
REDIS_URL=...                 # same as the API's
SETTINGS_ENCRYPTION_KEY=...   # same as the API's
```
Everything else the Worker uses - object storage, the metadata providers'
keys (Spotify, Apple Music), MusicBrainz's contact - it reads from what's
saved in the Admin UI, like the API does; `SETTINGS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is what
decrypts the secrets saved there, so it must be the API's exact value. Only
if you configure those through env vars instead (`R2_*`, `SPOTIFY_*`,
`APPLE_MUSIC_*`, `MUSICBRAINZ_CONTACT`) does the Worker need them too.
Admin > Metadata > **Background jobs** warns when the running Worker has no
`SETTINGS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, or one that isn't the API's (#95) - its logs then
say "SETTINGS_ENCRYPTION_KEY is not set" or "can't be decrypted". An env var
changed in Dokploy only reaches the container on the next deploy.

It doesn't need `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `AUTH_URL`, `WEB_URL`, the
Resend/Google vars or `PORT`: it serves no HTTP traffic and signs nothing.
Leave `JOBS_IN_API` unset (or `false`) on the API when you run a Worker.

### Web app

**Application**, configured as:
- Source: this repo, branch `main`
- Build type: **Dockerfile**
- Dockerfile path: `Dockerfile.web`
- Build context: `.`
- Port: `3000`
- Domain: `app.songverse.one`
- Watch paths (if you use auto-deploy): `apps/web/**`, `packages/core/**`, `packages/tsconfig/**`, `Dockerfile.web`, `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`

Environment variables:
```
API_URL=https://api.songverse.one
PORT=3000
```

That's it — the web app no longer talks to Postgres or BetterAuth directly (see the "Where auth lives" note below), so it doesn't need `DATABASE_URL`, `AUTH_URL`, `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `SETTINGS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, or the Resend/Google vars at all anymore; those all live on the API app now (see above).

**Old links keep working.** The web app lived at `songverse.one` until it moved to `app.songverse.one` (#42), and links already sent out still point there: verification and password-reset emails, set share links, claim links, bookmarks. The website now at `songverse.one` sends any path that isn't one of its pages to the same path on the app (see "Site app" below).

(Without a website, the web app can do it itself: give it both domains, and set `WEB_URL=https://app.songverse.one` and `REDIRECT_HOSTS=songverse.one` on it. A request for a listed host is redirected to the same page on `WEB_URL` - see `apps/web/redirect-hosts.mjs`.)

### Moving the web app from songverse.one to app.songverse.one

A one-time change for a deployment that predates the move (#42). The API accepts sign-ins from one web address at a time (`WEB_URL`), so do steps 3 and 4 back to back, at a quiet time: in between, the app works at only one of the two addresses.
1. **Site app:** create it (see "Site app" below), without a domain for now, and deploy it.
2. **Web app:** add the domain `app.songverse.one`, keeping `songverse.one` for now.
3. **API and Worker:** change `WEB_URL` to `https://app.songverse.one`, and redeploy both. The API now trusts, and sends links to, the new address.
4. **Move `songverse.one`:** remove it from the web app's domains and add it to the site app's. The website now answers there, and sends app links on to `app.songverse.one`.
5. **Check:**
   - `https://songverse.one` shows the website, and `https://songverse.one/library` redirects to `https://app.songverse.one/library`;
   - signing in with a password works, and you're still signed in after reloading;
   - signing in with a passkey made before the move works (its relying-party ID was, and stays, `songverse.one`);
   - Google sign-in works, if it's set up (its redirect URI is on the API, so nothing changes there).

Sessions survive the move: the session cookie's domain is `songverse.one` before and after.

Deploy the API and Worker first, then the Web app (Web's build doesn't strictly depend on the others being up, but it's a sane order).

**Where auth lives:** BetterAuth is mounted in `apps/api`, not here — the web app is just another HTTP client of the API for auth, exactly like it already was for every other endpoint. This matters mainly if you're adding a mobile app later: it talks to the same API for both login and data, rather than needing to know about the web app's URL at all. See `apps/api/src/auth/` for the actual auth config, and `apps/web/src/lib/server-auth.ts`/`auth-client.ts` for how the web app calls it.

### Site app

The website at the root domain (`apps/site`, #43): one static page in English and French, served by nginx, which sends any other path on to the app.

**Application**, configured as:
- Source: this repo, branch `main`
- Build type: **Dockerfile**
- Dockerfile path: `Dockerfile.site`
- Build context: `.`
- Port: `80`
- Domain: `songverse.one`
- Watch paths (if you use auto-deploy): `apps/site/**`, `Dockerfile.site`, `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`

Environment variables: none needed. `APP_URL` (default `https://app.songverse.one`) is where paths that aren't website pages are redirected.

### Docs app

The user documentation (`apps/docs`), a static site served by nginx.

**Application**, configured as:
- Source: this repo, branch `main`
- Build type: **Dockerfile**
- Dockerfile path: `Dockerfile.docs`
- Build context: `.`
- Port: `80`
- Domain: `docs.songverse.one`
- Watch paths (under the app's advanced settings, if you use auto-deploy): `apps/docs/**`, `Dockerfile.docs`, `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, so only docs changes rebuild it.

No environment variables. The build fails if any page links to a page or heading that doesn't exist, so a broken docs change never deploys.

## 3. Database migrations (automatic)

Nothing to run by hand. The API container applies any pending migrations each time it starts, before serving traffic (see the `CMD` in `Dockerfile.api`), so the first deploy creates the schema and later deploys pick up new migrations. Check the API's startup logs for Prisma's output: either the migrations it applied or `No pending migrations to apply.` If a migration fails, the API won't start and the error will be in those same logs.

The Worker doesn't migrate: its command override (`node dist/worker.js`) replaces the image's start command.

To run migrations manually anyway (e.g. to retry after fixing a failure), open a shell in the running **API** container and run:
```
/repo/packages/db/node_modules/.bin/prisma migrate deploy --schema /repo/packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma
```
Don't use `pnpm --filter @songverse/db exec ...` there: the image doesn't include the pnpm workspace files, so pnpm finds no matching project and silently does nothing.

## 4. Verify

- `https://api.songverse.one/health` → `{"status":"ok"}`
- `https://api.songverse.one/api/docs` → interactive API documentation
- `https://songverse.one` → the website, in English (`/fr/` in French)
- `https://app.songverse.one` → the app's sign-in page (and `https://songverse.one/library` redirects there)
- `https://docs.songverse.one` → the documentation, with a language menu (English, Français)
- Sign up for an account → should land on `/dashboard`, showing your name and the results of a live call to the API
- On a set, **Sync** → **Turn sync on** → it says who's leading (or that no one is) rather than "Connecting…": the WebSocket gets through

If all of those work, the deployment is healthy end to end: DNS → HTTPS → Web → Auth → API → Database.

## Gotchas already hit (and fixed in the repo)

These were real failures during the first deploy. The fixes are already committed, but they're documented here in case a future change accidentally reintroduces one of them.

#### 1. Docker build context
Both Dockerfiles live at the **repo root** (`Dockerfile.api`, `Dockerfile.web`), not inside `apps/api/` or `apps/web/`. They need to reach sibling folders (`packages/*`) during the build, and some platforms — Dokploy included — default the build context to "the directory the Dockerfile is in," ignoring a separately configured context path. Keeping the Dockerfiles at the root sidesteps the ambiguity entirely: wherever the Dockerfile is *is* the context.

#### 2. pnpm version drift
Both Dockerfiles pin pnpm explicitly with `corepack prepare pnpm@10.33.0 --activate` in the base stage, rather than letting corepack lazily resolve a version from `package.json` at first use. Without this, a newer base image's corepack silently fetched pnpm 12 instead of the pinned 10.33.0, and pnpm 12 resolves monorepo workspaces more strictly — breaking the (normal, standard) "copy `package.json` files first, then install" layer-caching pattern both Dockerfiles use.

#### 3. Missing OpenSSL
Both Dockerfiles now `apt-get install openssl` in the base stage. `node:22-slim` doesn't include it, and Prisma's query engine needs it to detect which binary variant to use — without it, Prisma falls back to a guess that happens to work on some hosts and might not on others.

#### 4. `vite preview` blocking the production domain
`apps/web/vite.config.ts` sets `preview.allowedHosts: true`. By default, `vite preview` (which is what serves the Web app in production here — see the comment at the top of `Dockerfile.web` for why) only trusts `localhost`, as a defense meant for a developer's own machine. Behind Dokploy's reverse proxy, that protection is redundant — the proxy already controls which domains reach the container.

#### 5. The API URL must be a runtime value, not baked in at build time
`apps/web/src/lib/public-env.ts` reads `API_URL` from the container's environment at request time, rather than through Vite's `VITE_`-prefixed build-time env inlining. The build-time approach requires the hosting platform to correctly pass a value as a Docker *build argument* specifically (not just a regular env var), which didn't work reliably here. If `/users/me` or similar ever starts failing again with something like `Failed to parse URL from /users/me`, it means `API_URL` isn't set on the Web app's environment variables.

#### 6. Auth's session cookie and CORS have to agree on the exact origin
Since BetterAuth moved into `apps/api`, its session cookie is set by `api.songverse.one` but needs to be usable by pages served from `app.songverse.one` — a genuinely cross-origin (though same-site) setup. Two things have to be configured together, in `apps/api/src/main.ts` / `auth/better-auth.ts`, or sign-in silently stops persisting:
- CORS must name the web app's **exact** origin (`WEB_URL`) with `credentials: true` — `cors: true` (reflecting any origin) or a wildcard origin cannot be combined with credentialed requests; the browser will drop the cookie.
- BetterAuth's `advanced.crossSubDomainCookies` must be enabled **with an explicit `domain`** of the shared parent (`songverse.one`). Enabling it without one doesn't help: BetterAuth then defaults the domain to `AUTH_URL`'s own hostname (`api.songverse.one`), which the web app still never sees. `better-auth.ts` derives this domain from `AUTH_URL`/`WEB_URL`, so in practice this means those two env vars must be right.

If sign-in appears to succeed (a 200 comes back) but the user is immediately signed out again on the next page load, check these two first — it's almost always one of them, usually caused by `WEB_URL`/`AUTH_URL` being wrong or swapped.

## Redeploying after a code change

Push to `main`, then trigger a rebuild in Dokploy for whichever app(s) changed (API and Worker share an image, so a backend change means rebuilding both). New Prisma migrations apply automatically when the API restarts (see step 3).

### Watch paths

With auto-deploy on, Dokploy rebuilds an app only when a push changes a file matching its watch paths. They're exactly what each app's Dockerfile copies:

| App | Watch paths |
|---|---|
| API, Worker | `apps/api/**`, `packages/core/**`, `packages/db/**`, `packages/secret-crypto/**`, `packages/tsconfig/**`, `Dockerfile.api` |
| Web | `apps/web/**`, `packages/core/**`, `packages/tsconfig/**`, `Dockerfile.web` |
| Site | `apps/site/**`, `Dockerfile.site` |
| Docs | `apps/docs/**`, `Dockerfile.docs` |

Every app also watches the root `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`: every image installs its dependencies from them, so a dependency change rebuilds them all.

- `packages/core` (shared types, translations, the API client) is in both the API's and the Web's: a change there has to reach both, or the web app and the API disagree.
- `packages/db` holds the Prisma schema and migrations: a new migration rebuilds the API, which applies it as it starts (step 3).
- `e2e/`, `docs/` and the `.md` files at the root aren't in any image, so changing them rebuilds nothing.

If a Dockerfile starts copying something new (another package, say), add it to that app's watch paths too, or a change there won't redeploy it.
