# Songverse

A songbook and set-planning app for worship teams and musicians: keep your
chord charts in one library, organise them into songbooks, plan what you're
playing on Sunday, and share it with the people playing with you.

User documentation, in English and French: [docs.songverse.one](https://docs.songverse.one) (source in `apps/docs`).

## Features

- **Song library** – personal, team and global songs, added and edited
  on one tabbed screen (Song info, Editor, Files, Audio, Links). Upload
  or paste a chart as ChordPro, "chords over lyrics" or lyrics only (the
  format is detected, with how sure the guess is) and it's parsed into a
  structured chart, previewed live beside the text; export back to
  ChordPro. Each song has artists, composers, lyricists and other
  credits (autocompleted from names already in your library), a version
  name, and its own subtitle, sort title, album, year, key, time
  signature, capo, tempo, duration, copyright, CCLI, ISRC, reference and
  notes; plus tags, streaming links (Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube), file
  attachments with image thumbnails, and audio recordings to play in the
  page. Adding a song whose title is already in your library offers to
  open it, start from it, or add another version of it; translations and
  other versions are filed together.
- **Global catalogue** – submit a personal or team song for everyone to
  use. Reviewers (a role granted in Admin > Users) and global admins
  approve it, ask for changes, reject it, or merge it into a global song
  it duplicates; similar global songs are flagged when it's submitted.
  Approving publishes a copy and links your song to it, so yours stays
  yours to change. Global admins can also publish their own songs
  directly, when they choose to.
- **MusicBrainz matching** – link a song to its MusicBrainz recording and
  work to pull in artist and songwriter credits.
- **Songbooks** – simple or numbered collections, built by hand, imported
  from a published songbook catalogue, or filled by bulk-uploading files
  matched to entries.
- **Songbook catalogues** – the numbers, titles, credits, keys, tempos,
  scripture references and tags of published songbooks (facts only, no
  lyrics), kept in an editable table, imported and exported as CSV or JSON
  ([format](docs/songbook-catalog-format.md)). Songs created from a
  catalogue entry start with its details filled in.
- **Sets** – ordered song lists for a service or gig, dated or named, with
  drag-and-drop ordering, a version and key per song. Personal or owned by
  a team; share one with guest musicians by link, who can read every song
  in it and keep private notes. A personal set can move to a team, sharing
  its owner's songs read-only until they hand them over.
- **Arrangements** – how you or your band play a song, without changing
  it: its order, key, capo and tempo, and chords replaced or hidden, lines
  hidden and notes added on some passes. A team's usual arrangement is
  picked when the song goes into its sets, and any set can give a song its
  own order just for that set. Players choose their own view
  on top: chords hidden for them, simpler chords, capo shapes, solfège
  ([format](docs/arrangement-document-v2.md)).
- **Teams** – invite links, member and admin roles, and each member's
  instruments and other roles (sound, media, tech) shown on the team.
- **Accounts** – email and password, passkeys and Google sign-in; email
  verification, password reset and email change; avatars; per-user storage
  limits.
- **Admin** – manage users (ban, grant the reviewer role, delete with or
  without handing their content over), storage (Cloudflare R2 or local disk), sign-in providers
  and email, all editable in the app rather than only through environment
  variables.
- **English and French**, and usable on a phone.

## Getting started

Requires Node 22.18+, pnpm and Docker.

```sh
pnpm install
docker compose up -d postgres redis
cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env       # then fill in the values
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env
cp packages/db/.env.example packages/db/.env
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm dev                                     # web :3000, API :3001, docs :4321, website :4322
```

`pnpm lint`, `pnpm type-check` and `pnpm test` run the checks across the
workspace, through Vite+'s task runner (`vp run`), which replays a package's
result when nothing it reads has changed; `pnpm exec vp cache clean` starts
over. The lint rules are in the root `vite.config.ts`. `pnpm e2e` runs the end-to-end suites (API and browser) against
the running app - see [e2e/README.md](e2e/README.md). See [Deploy.md](Deploy.md) for production setup.

## How it's built

Songverse is written with a lot of AI assistance: the maintainer sets the
direction, writes the specs and issues, and reviews, edits and decides what
is merged, with an AI coding assistant doing much of the typing. We say so
plainly because you should know. What keeps it trustworthy is the same as
for any project: every behaviour is covered by end-to-end and unit tests,
the shared rules are written down in the repository, and changes are
reviewed by a person before they reach `main`. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for what we ask of contributions, with or
without AI.

## Licence

Songverse is free software: you can use it, study it, share it and change
it under the terms of the [GNU Affero General Public License, version 3](LICENSE)
(AGPL-3.0). If you run a modified copy that other people use over a
network, the licence asks you to offer them its source: the app links to
it (**Source code**, in the account menu and on the sign-in page) through
`SOURCE_CODE_URL` in `packages/core/src/constants/index.ts` - point it at
your own.

Songs, charts and recordings people add to a Songverse server are theirs,
not covered by this licence.
