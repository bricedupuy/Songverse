description: A set's lyrics on a big screen for the audience, or its chart for the band, led from Live.
---

A **screen** shows a set on a big screen: the lyrics for the audience, two lines at a time, or the chart for the band. It can be a TV's browser, a laptop or a small computer plugged into a projector, or an old tablet. Whoever leads the set presents it from [Live](/sets/#playing-a-set-live), and every screen follows.

## Pairing a screen

1. On the screen, open **songverse.one/screen**. Nobody signs in there: it shows a code and a QR code. The code changes every 10 minutes until it's used.

2. On your phone or tablet, scan the QR code, or open **Screens** from the Sync menu in Live (**Screens…**) and type the code.
3. Give the screen a **Name** ("Church TV"), pick the **Set** it shows and what it **Shows**: **Lyrics, for the audience** or **The chart, for the band**. Then **Pair screen**.

The screen remembers it's paired: next time, open the same page and it reconnects by itself. Only someone who can edit the set (its owner, or an admin of its team) can pair a screen to it, because they're the ones who lead it.

On **Screens**, each screen of the set can be renamed, moved to another set or switched between lyrics and chart; the screen changes at once. **Disconnect** stops it: it goes back to showing a new code.

## Presenting from Live

Presenting uses [Sync](/sets/#playing-in-sync): the screens are members of the set's session.

1. In Live, open the Sync menu, **Turn sync on**, then **Lead the set**. Paired screens are listed there with the other members, marked "(screen)".
2. Choose **Present on screens**. A panel opens at the bottom of Live, showing what the screens show.

- **Next slide** and **Previous slide** (the arrows on each side) move two lines at a time. On a keyboard or a Bluetooth page-turner pedal, the down arrow or Page Down goes on, and the up arrow or Page Up goes back. Past a song's last slide, Live moves to the next song of the set and the screens follow; back past its first, to the previous song's last slide.
- The song's sections (V1, C, V2…) under the slide jump straight to one, for a chorus sung again or a verse dropped.
- **Black screen** blanks every screen, for prayer, talking or between songs. Press it again to bring the words back.
- **Stop presenting**, in the Sync menu, leaves the screens showing the set's name.

## What the screens show

With **Lyrics, for the audience**, each slide's two lines are big and centred. The line before is faint above, the line after faint below, and each slide fades in - in the default look; a [theme](/screens/#themes) changes all of it. A section without words, like an instrumental, is an empty slide, so you step through the song as the band plays it. A song's first slide shows its title, and its first and last show its credits at the bottom: who wrote it, its copyright and its CCLI song number, from the song's details.

With **The chart, for the band**, the screen shows the song's chart with chords, in the set's key, and keeps the section being sung highlighted and in view.

The words come from the version and key the set plays. Song notes and chords are never shown to the audience. If the screen loses its connection, it says so in a corner and reconnects by itself.

## Themes

A theme is how a screen looks: its font, colours and background, the lines around the current ones, where the words sit, and how slides come and go. Each screen has its own: a stage monitor can show big capitals at the top while the audience screen has a moving background. Pick one in **Theme** on the screen's row, under **Your screens**; the screen changes at once.

**Built-in themes** each play on a sample song, so you see how they move:

- **Classic** - white words on black, the line before and after dimmed: the default.
- **Concert** - bold capitals over moving coloured light, words revealed one by one.
- **Chapel** - an elegant serif on warm dark tones, lines fading in.
- **Sunrise** - rounded words over slow warm waves that brighten in a chorus.
- **Starlight** - a serif glowing in over rising points of light.
- **Spotlight** - tall display letters under sweeping stage lights.
- **Stream** - outlined words in a lower third, leaving the picture above free for a video or a livestream.
- **Minimal** - left-aligned and quiet, the next lines in view, typed in.
- **Stage monitor** - big capitals at the top and the whole section, for the band.

**Customize** opens one in the theme editor, with its preview beside the settings - at **16:9** or **4:3**, on the lyrics or the band's chart - changing as you change them. **⏵** plays the sample song, **‹ ›** go slide by slide.

- **Text** - the font, its size (**Fit the line**, or fixed), weight, colour, **Capitals**, **Readability** (a shadow, an outline or a glow, for words over a moving background), alignment, line and letter spacing.
- **Lines** - **The slide**, with the lines before and after it, or **The whole section** with the slide's lines picked out; the lines around them **Dimmed**, **Smaller**, **Blurred** or **Hidden**.
- **Layout** - top, centre, bottom or **Lower third**, and a **Safe margin** for TVs that crop their edges.
- **Background** - a **Colour**, a **Gradient**, or moving light: **Aurora**, **Waves**, **Particles**, **Spotlight**, in up to four colours. **Moves with the song** sends a pulse of light with each slide and brightens it in a chorus. **Darken** keeps words readable over anything.
- **Motion** - **Between slides**: a cut, a fade, a slide, rise, scale, blur or zoom, and how long it takes (a new song takes twice as long). **Words appear** all at once, line by line, word by word, letter by letter, typed or glowing.
- **Title and credits** - whether to show the song's title and its credits (writers, copyright, CCLI number), on which slides and where.
- **Chords** - for **The chart, for the band**: the chords' colour and the chart's size.

The editor checks the contrast between the words and the background and warns when it's under 4.5:1. Name the theme and **Save theme**: it's yours, or - if you're an admin of a team - the team's, for every member to pick for their screens (only its admins change it). A theme you can change has **Edit** and **Delete**; deleting it puts its screens back to the default look.

Everything that moves is drawn by the screen's graphics chip, so it stays smooth on a TV's browser. A viewer whose device asks for reduced motion gets still backgrounds and simple fades.

To try a built-in theme on one screen, or to show the words in streaming software (as a browser source), add `?theme=` and its name to the screen's address: **songverse.one/screen?theme=stream**. It's for that device only, until the address changes.
