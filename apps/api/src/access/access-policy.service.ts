 *   song), a user's own songs, their teams' songs, songs shared with them
 *   (AccessGrant, issue #77), and the songs of a songbook shared with them
 *   or their teams, while they're in it (issue #211). Reviewers can also
 *   open a song while it's submitted to the global catalogue.
 * - Songbooks: anyone sees global songbooks, plus their own, their teams',
 *   and those shared with them or their teams (SongbookShare, issue #211).
 * - Tags: approved global tags, the user's own, and their teams'.
 * - Arrangements: the user's own and their teams' (of songs they can see;
 *   through a set, anyone who can open the set sees the one it plays).
 * - Changing a song, songbook or arrangement: its owner for a personal one, the team's
 *   admins for a team one, and only global admins for a global one. Global
 *   admins can change anything. A songbook shared to edit: its entries and
 *   details too (canEditSongbook), not deleting or sharing it. Someone a song is shared with to edit
 *   changes its chart, details and credits (canEditContent), not the rest
 *   (deleting, publishing, sharing it…).
