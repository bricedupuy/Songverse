/**
 * The Worker (issue #92): the same image and app graph as the API
 * (src/main.ts), with no HTTP listener, running the background jobs - bulk
 * songbook uploads, the hourly purge of expired transfers, and lookups (a
 * new song's artwork, new artists' pictures and bios, the admin's
 * backfills). The API only adds jobs to the queues, unless JOBS_IN_API
 * says it runs them too (by default, out of production, so `pnpm dev`
 * works without a Worker). Its heartbeat in Redis shows it's running in
 * Admin > Metadata > Background jobs.
 *
 * The queues' Redis connections hold the event loop open; the heartbeat's
 * timer does too.
